keep track of an input index. used for iterating.

declare a float for the input, odd input sum, even input sum, odd input count, and even input count.

print enter first number

scanf into the input variable
if the input variable isn't empty, declare a temporary sum variable to zero
declare a remaining input to the input value
while remaining input isn't zero, set the remaining input to the remaining input - remaining input % 10, all divided by 10. this isolates each digit. you then add those digits to the tempsum.

if the tempsum is even, add the input to the even input sum. do opposite if odd

increment the count by 1

print by divinging the input sum by the input count (takes the average)
