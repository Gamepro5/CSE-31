TPS 1:

5.) Yes. You do, otherwise it will just be overritten to n.

TPS 2:

1.) I think that it will print 1,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,1,3. total 29. I was correct but i forgot about the sum part.
2.) It does nothing right now.
3.) 
4.) $a0 is the convention for arguments of a function.
5.) Move the print value into a temp register. $t6 or something.
6.) Room for 3 integers is reserved. I know that $ra, $a0, and $v0 need to be stored.
10.) Because we may need to use the $a0 given to us by main after calling these functions.The state of the parent call of recursion must be kept.
12.) The next recursion call with be m-3 instead of m-1 because we already decreased it by m-2. We also need to push the ouput of the first recursion call to the stack so we can use it after to sum both up.
15.) $ra.
